# QuikTok

**Crowded city, lonely people.** QuikTok is an anti-social-network social networking app designed to connect nearby individuals face-to-face based on shared topics of interest. By minimizing digital distractions and fostering organic, real-world connections, QuikTok aims to bring people closer together.

This project was developed as part of **HackRU**, the Hackathon at Rutgers University. Learn more about it on our [Devpost Page](https://devpost.com/software/quiktok?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects).

## ðŸš€ Inspiration

In today's world, people are often overwhelmed by the abundance of online interactions. University students, in particular, face social exhaustion, which can lower their willingness to seek meaningful connections. QuikTok is an optimization tool that helps users connect whenever and wherever they need.

Our inspiration was rooted in creating a platform that facilitates organic human interaction with minimal technological intervention. Unlike traditional social media, QuikTok emphasizes in-person connection, allowing users to meet and converse in their physical surroundings.

### Ideal Use Cases:
- **College campuses** for fostering student connections
- **Libraries** to enable academic collaboration
- **Elderly communities** seeking companionship
- **Communal spaces** such as parks and cafes

## ðŸ’» How We Built It

QuikTok was created as a project for **HackRU**, the Hackathon at Rutgers University. The development process involved:

### **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: Flask (Python) for API development.
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas for flexible, dynamic data storage.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for responsive design.
- **Geolocation**: HTML Geolocation API to capture user locations.
- **Collaboration Tools**: CodeSandbox for real-time development and communication.

### **Development Process**
- **Design**: Initial planning was done via Google Docs, where we sketched out pages and designed the database schema.
- **Implementation**: Integration of frontend and backend using Flask APIs for GET and POST requests.
- **Testing**: Multiple rounds of debugging, especially during API and database integration.
