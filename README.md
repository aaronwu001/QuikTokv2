## üöÄ Inspiration

In today's world, people are often overwhelmed by the abundance of online interactions. University students, in particular, face social exhaustion, which can lower their willingness to seek meaningful connections. QuikTok is an optimization tool that helps users connect whenever and wherever they need.

Our inspiration was rooted in creating a platform that facilitates organic human interaction with minimal technological intervention. Unlike traditional social media, QuikTok emphasizes in-person connection, allowing users to meet and converse in their physical surroundings.

### Ideal Use Cases:
- **College campuses** for fostering student connections
- **Libraries** to enable academic collaboration
- **Elderly communities** seeking companionship
- **Communal spaces** such as parks and cafes

## üíª How We Built It
QuikTok was a project in HackRU, Hackthon at Rutgers University.
### **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: Flask (Python) for API development.
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas for flexible, dynamic data storage.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for responsive design.
- **Geolocation**: HTML Geolocation API to capture user locations.
- **Collaboration Tools**: CodeSandbox for real-time development and communication.

### **Development Process**
- **Design**: Initial planning was done via Google Docs, where we sketched out pages and designed the database schema.
- **Implementation**: Integration of frontend and backend using Flask APIs for GET and POST requests.
- **Testing**: Multiple rounds of debugging, especially during API and database integration.

## üèÜ Accomplishments

- Successfully built a fully functional prototype under tight hackathon time constraints.
- Designed an intuitive user interface without using modern JavaScript frameworks like React.
- Gained practical experience with Flask, MongoDB, and geolocation APIs.
- Created a platform that addresses real-world problems and fosters genuine human connection.

## üå± Challenges We Faced

- **Time Constraints**: Deciding which features to prioritize while ensuring the app remained functional.
- **API Design**: Early design decisions on APIs led to inefficiencies and required extensive debugging.
- **Database Integration**: Issues transferring data between components due to mismatched data types and schema changes.

## üìö Lessons Learned

- Planning and designing APIs more thoroughly before implementation can save significant time.
- The importance of data transfer between frontend, backend, and database for seamless integration.
- Collaboration tools like CodeSandbox are invaluable for real-time teamwork in hackathons.
